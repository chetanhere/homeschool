# Summary

Today is the age of information and information is available without much efforts. Kids can consume a lot and kids have healthy options. 
This is a fast running world and investing 7 hours a day for 12 years seems too much effort to achieve regular schooling.
"HomeSchool" repository is build with a purpose to provide alternate to regular schooling. I am starting with few study plans and quality resources available for free.

Going forward, we shall be having regular local meetups and regular compeitions (driven by society) at various levels.
These competition will be there at 
1. Housing society level
2. Zone level
3. District level
4. State level
5. National level and may be
6. International level

Small community schools will be run by parents and under-previledged kids will get their schooling with our kids.
